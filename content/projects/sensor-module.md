## Overview

This project involved the design and implementation of a modular sensor interface for a driving simulator system. It was designed to replicate typical vehicle control inputs and interface them as a USB Human Interface Device (HID), enabling driver action monitoring in evaluation systems.

## Connected Sensors

The module supports the following inputs:

- Gear lever (position detection)
- Turn signals (left/right indicators)
- Ignition switch (start button)
- Seatbelt sensor
- Parking brake sensor
- Directional indicator control
- Extra digital Input/Output connectors

## Technologies Used

- **Microcontroller**: Arduino Pro Micro (ATmega32U4)
- **Design tools**: KiCad, SolidWorks
- **Connection standard**: RJ interfaces for modular sensor inputs
- **USB Interface**: HID profile to be recognized as a joystick/controller
