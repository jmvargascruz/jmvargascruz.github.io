- Constructed and assembled the fuselage and propulsion elements.
- Performed motor–propeller characterization using a custom-built test bench.
- Participated in telemetry setup, weight distribution analysis, and test flights.
- Competed in the official SAE Aerodesign México 2023.

## Technologies Used
- SolidWorks for mechanical design
