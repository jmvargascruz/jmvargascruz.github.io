## Overview

This project consists of a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis of the GOE398 airfoil using Ansys Fluent. The objective was to evaluate the airfoil’s aerodynamic behavior at various angles of attack under steady-state conditions. The study includes pressure and velocity fields, as well as lift and drag coefficient.

The results were included in a presentation at the XVII Ansys Convergence Mexico 2020, focused on basic aerodynamic analysis.


## Methodology

- The airfoil profile was modeled in 2D.
- Simulations were performed for angles of attack between 0° and 20°.
- A structured mesh was generated and refined near the boundary layer.

## Analysis Parameters

- Pressure coefficient distribution
- Velocity magnitude and streamlines
- Lift and drag coefficient estimation
- Stall onset and boundary layer behavior

## Tools and Technologies

- **Simulation:** Ansys Fluent
